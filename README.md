# Degree of Difficulty API
This is a simple API I built for listing all dives and the degree of difficulty
for each dive on each board. I have also included a script for creating a 
MongoDB collection for all dives.

## Endpoints

* Lists all dives

**/api/dives/front**
* Lists all front dives

**/api/dives/back**
* Lists all back dives

**/api/dives/reverse**
* Lists all reverse dives

**/api/dives/inward**
* Lists all inward dives

**/api/dives/twister**
* Lists all twister dives

**/api/dives/armstand**
* Lists all armstand dives

**/api/dives/\<dive number\>**
* Displays single dive by number e.g., /api/dive/103
